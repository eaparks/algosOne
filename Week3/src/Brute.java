/**
 * Created by eparks on 10/7/2014.
 *
 * Write a program Brute.java that examines 4 points at a time and checks
 * whether they all lie on the same line segment, printing out any such line
 * segments to standard output and drawing them using standard drawing.
 * To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether
 * the slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal.
 *
 * The order of growth of the running time of your program should be N4 in the
 * worst case and it should use space proportional to N.
